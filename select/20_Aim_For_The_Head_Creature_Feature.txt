Can I pose a question?
How do you kill what is dead?
I just shoot from the hip
And I aim for the head
He used to be your friend
That was another life
With a single bullet
We're gonna blow his mind
With a loaded gun
And a steady hand
We just might live through this (Aim for the head)
If you kill the brain
Then you kill the ghoul
And its motor functions (Aim for the head)
Nail up all the windows
They're gonna settle the score
Make sure no chamber is bare
They're right outside the door
This is a test of your strength
And your will to survive
If you give up now
They're gonna eat you alive
With a loaded gun
And a steady hand
We just might live through this (Aim for the head)
If you kill the brain
Then you kill the ghoul
And his motor functions (Aim for the head)
Listen to me
Listen to me
Listen to me, save yourself
There is no more
There is no more
There is no more room in hell
I will help you
I will help you
I will help you understand
Come with me now
Come with me now
Come with me now, take my hand
We can make it
We can make it
We can make it through this
With a loaded gun
And a steady hand
We just might live through this (Aim for the head)
If you kill the brain
Then you kill the ghoul
And his motor functions (Aim for the head)
Is the end of the world
Or just the start of the fight
You better heed my warning
And watch out for their bite
They have a taste for your flesh
And for your blood, they will crave
They're coming for us now
From beyond the grave
