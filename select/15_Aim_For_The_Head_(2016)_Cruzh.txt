Aim for the head, cause she ain't got a heart
She'll tear your world apart
The devil disguised with a pack of lies
You'd better run for your life

Alone in the night, she will breake down the wall, like no other
She likes when you drive, but hides if you cry, doesn't bother
Decieved by a look, It's so easy to fall on the wild side
Waking up dead and you lost it all in a skyride
Yeah
Caught in her arms, you'll get tied up on her lies
Spend all your time getting down just to satisfy

Aim for the head, cause she ain't got a heart
She'll tear your world apart
The devil disguised with a pack of lies
You'd better run for your life

Storm coming down, she's crawing away
Can you take it?
When everything's gone, she'll dissapear
Can't believe it
That empty shell, with the need to take control
You stand alone, with the life you left behind

Aim for the head, cause she ain't got a heart
She'll tear your world apart
The devil disguised with a pack of lies,
You'd better run for your life

Aim for the head, cause she ain't got a heart
She'll tear your world apart
The devil disguised with a pack of lies,

You'd better run for your life
Aim for the head, ain't got a heart
She'll tear your world apart
The devil disguised with a pack of lies,
Aim to the head
Tear your world apart
You better run for your life
