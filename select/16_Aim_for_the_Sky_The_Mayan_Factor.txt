Still find you waiting here
That feeling doesn't pass
I find you searching
Looking down from above

Still feel the way you do
So sad so deep in the blue
You hurt from the silence

I hold my eyes when I break us
I don't wanna see me
Hold my head down when I break us
No shame

When I'm old and I'm wise
And my life pass in front of me
Will you remember me?

When I'm old deep inside
See the sunshine in your eyes
You take my breath away

When can I see you again?

Twelve thousand moons later
Stellar, you're selling up
I keep on searching
But you're sent from above

I feel the way I do
So sad so deep in the blue
I hurt from the silence, I

Hold my head down when I break us
You don't wanna see me
Hold my eyes when I break us
No shame

When I'm old and I'm wise
And my life pass in front of me
Will you remember me?

When I'm old deep inside
See the sunshine in your eyes
You take my breath away

When can I see you again?
Will I see you again?
Again
Uuh

When I'm old and I'm wise
And my life pass in front of me
Will you remember me?

When I'm old deep inside
See the sunshine in your eyes
You take my breath away

When I'm old and I'm wise
And my life pass in front of me
Will you remember me?

When I'm old deep inside
See the sunshine in your eyes
You take my breath away
